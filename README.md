# Sorting Visualizer

The Sorting Visualizer is a tool that helps in visualizing 
sorting algorithms in action.

Choose an algorithm by pressing 'i' (for insertion sort), 'm'
(for merge sort), 'q' (for quick sort) and 'r' for generating new 
set of bars or to stop the algorithm in between, and then click
on the visualize button to visualize algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented 

The application supports the following algorithms.

- **Insertion Sort** - Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that
        places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each 
        iteration. It is suitable for small data values.

- **Merge Sort** - Merge sort uses divide and conquer strategy 
        to sort an array. So, in this algorithm, the array is 
        initially divided into two equal halves and then they are 
        combined in a sorted manner.

- **Quick Sort** - Quick sort also uses divide and conquer strategy
        .It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given 
        array around the picked pivot.
